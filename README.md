# Annual-People-Analytics-Report

## Overview:

At the end of every year, MKR People Analytics Team publishes an Annual People Analytics Report to be distributed to relevant stakeholders & management. For the last two years (from the beginning of 2010 until the end of 2011), MKR has been focusing a lot on improving employee retention and hiring activity. 

Some of our objectives were to increase employee retention rate & company growth rate, through initiatives such as allocating budget for new tenure-based reward programs, conducting a more thorough manpower planning based on historical data, as well as ensuring hiring inclusivity in regards to age & gender distributions among employees. 

This year (2011), we would like to evaluate whether the efforts have been successful or not. As a People Analytics Associate, We need to make sure that this year’s Annual People Analytics Report provides all the insights needed to answer the questions regarding the success of our previously launched initiatives.

## SQL Objective:
In order to evaluate the previously-launched initiatives, We need to write as SQL script to conduct several analyses. Some of additional informations We might need based on our previous Annual People Analytics Report: 

    • We successfully retained 95,75% of our employees from the beginning of 2009 by the end of 2010. 
    • From 2009 to 2010, our number of employees grew by 1,5%

  1. Calculate our Employee Retention Rate from 2010 to 2011 by dividing the total number of active employees at the end of 2011 by the total number of employees from the beginning of 2010. Compare the number with our previous retention rate from 2009 to 2010.
  2. Calculate our Company Growth Rate from 2010 to 2011 by dividing the total number of active employees at the end of 2011 by the total number of active employees from the end of 2010. Compare the number with our previous growth rate from 2009 to 2010.
  3. We’re going to launch a new tenure-based reward program in 2012. Only those who stayed until the end of 2011 will be eligible for this program. Calculate the total budget that we will have to allocate for this program with details as stated below (p.s. Each employee will be categorized based on their tenure by the time the 2011 data was recorded).
     - Tenure group 0 - 5 years: $100 / person
     - Tenure group 6 - 10 years: $200 / person
     - Tenure group 11 - 15 years: $300 / person
     - Tenure group 15 years & above: $500 / person.
  5. In terms of hiring, we wanted to ensure that we maintain a roughly equal number of male & female active employees across age groups:
     - Below 30 years
     - 31 - 40 years
     - 41 - 50 years
     - 51 - 60 years
     - 60 years and above.
  7. To make an informed decision in regards to manpower planning, figure out what the Top 3 departments & City are in terms of hiring (based on a number of new joiners).

## Dashboard:

MKR Annual People Analytics Report is usually visualized in an interactive dashboard format that can be accessed by relevant stakeholders & management. As a People Analytics Associate, We are expected to prepare a visualization of the previously analyzed Employee Data. The dashboard is expected to show insights gained from the dataset. 
    - Total Employees (beginning of 2010)
    - Total Active Employees (end of 2011) 
    - Retention Rate (2010 - 2011) 
    - Growth Rate (2010 - 2011) 
    - Active Employee Distribution by City 7 
    - Total Active Employees by Tenure Group & Age Group 
    - Estimated Budget for Tenure-Based Reward Program in 2012 by Tenure Group 
    - Top 3 Department & City based on Total New Joiners
